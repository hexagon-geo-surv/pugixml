title: pugixml 1.15 release
---

pugixml-1.15 is out. This is a maintenance release that adds support for `std::string_view` along with compatibility improvements (read the [changelog](/docs/manual.html#v1.15) for details).

Highlights for this release include:

- Many `xml_attribute::` and `xml_node::` functions now transparently support `std::string_view` and `std::string` when C++17 support is detected.

You can [download the source package](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml/releases/download/v1.15/pugixml-1.15.zip) or get the new version from GitHub using the latest tag (https://github.com/zeux/pugixml).
